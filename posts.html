<p class="header"> An Ugly World </p>
<p>
A world that is cold and cruel
<br>Without love and and kindness
<br>Fear and hate cloud our minds
<br>And doubt and despair rule our hearts
<br>Gone are the days of solitude and peace
<br>And the innocence of youth
<br>The days grow dark and the night are cold
<br>And the things that once were are no more
<br>People are divided with war and hate
<br>And succumb to tragedy and flames
<br>We lie in tatters of our broken selves
<br>And the pieces scatter with the wind
<br>People who claim peace their only goal
<br>But when fight for power it starts they'll eat each other whole
<br>Their iron gloves point fingers and wage a war of blame
<br>And mankind will wilt in pain

<p class="header"> The Dalandan </p>
<p>Eating a dalandan is fun experience because of its skin that you cant eat.A dalandan is orange and is the size of a tennis ball. 
When you touch it, its skin feels rough. To eat it, you have to peel it. Just press your finger until you pierce the skin and continue until the fruit is bare. 
As you peel the skin, it makes this sort of sucking noise that will really make you curious about its taste. 
Your fingers will feel sticky and you will smell like the fruit. When you eat, its like a can of Royal inside your mouth,the flavor just bursts on your taste buds.
As you swallow it, it gives you a sort of icky feeling in your mouth but the taste is delicious. A dalandan is a really good fruit to eat and its fun eating it.</p>

<p class="header"> Traveling to and from School </p>
<p>  I live in Gun-ob, LLC in Mactan and getting to and from my school every day is a big hassle. I have to wake up early in the morning to make sure I won't get late. I usually wake up around 5:30 and it takes me at least 30 minutes to get ready for school. Classes start at 7:25 and even if I got out of the house by 6:00 I still make it just a few minutes before the bell rings. From there, I have to ride 4 times to get to school. I go through LLC's local fish market with a tricycle, then to the highway by riding 23D, then to Mabolo through 20B or 21B, then finally to UP Highschool Cebu on 04L. It's already exhausting with just that then I have to go through the entire school day then it's the same process getting back to my house. I have to go to Ayala with 04L, then to Parkmall with 20A or 20B, then to Opon with 23D and back to my house with a tricycle. Going a very long way just to get to school is something most people won't go through but after doing it for the last 2 years, I'm already used to it.

<p class="header"> Watching Anime </p>
<p>
  Watching anime is one of my favorite pastimes and hobbies because I get to see a very interesting story unfold before my eyes. The characters seem to come to life as I see them from the screen and I feel like I'm part of the story they're telling.

      I I started watching anime when I was 7. My first anime I watched was Fairy Tail and I continued to watch them because it was so fun watching the shows and it always brought a smile on my face. I love the story and the art and the ideas it tells you and the moral lesson you can acquire from watching anime. Usually, if it appeals to me or if it talks about ideals that I like or a genre that I like, I would watch any anime.

      At present I always try to find the time to watch worth watching anime, with good story plots and art. I try my best to understand what the creator of the anime is trying to express and what thoughts and ideas he/she's trying to express. Watching anime is and always will be one of my favorite hobbies and I don't think that will change anytime soon.

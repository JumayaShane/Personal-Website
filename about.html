<p> Hello everyone!, I'm Black and White and the site your currently on is a site I made for a project in my technology and livelihood education class.
This site will be all about my edublogs account.
<br>
<br>
<br> My real name is Lester Shane M. Jumaya. I live at Gun-ob, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. I am now a Grade 9 student but since the school year is over, I guess I'm a 4th year now.
I study at University of the Philippines Cebu at Lahug, Cebu city. I really like watching anime and playing fun games with my friends. I am usually seen online playing LoL or 
Dota 2. I like being by myself and just doing what i want to do, but I'm not a "on a whim" type of person. i always like to think before
I do anything.
